##Problem 1

**Part 1**

I cannot calculate the mean of each variable because the character and factor variables are not numbers, and therefore cannot be averaged as number. The mean of x is 2.446 and the mean of the logical variable is 0.7, which indicates taht x is greater than 2 in 70% of the runs. 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

#Create dataframe 
problem_one_df <- tibble(
  x = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5),
  prob_one_logical = ifelse(x > 2, TRUE, FALSE),
  prob_one_character = c("data", "science", "home", "work", "number", "one", "friday", "september", "21", "2018"),
  prob_one_factor = factor(c("fall", "winter", "spring", "summer", "fall", "fall", "winter", "winter", "fall", "summer"))
) 

#Show dataframe table
problem_one_df

#Find mean for each column. 
  #colMeans(problem_one_df) - commented out so that the chunk can run smoothly. 
  colMeans(problem_one_df[1:2])

```

**Part 2**

I am now able to calculate the mean of the factor variable after converting it into a numeric variable; each factor was assigned a numeric value (1 = fall, 2 = spring etc.) and the average is 2.4. This value is not helpful for interpretation, since the numbers were not assigned in "order" of the seasons (i.e. fall is 1 and winter is 4). The non-number character variables were assigned as "NAs" so while I cannot calculate a mean value for them, they do not inhibit the code and are assigned "NA" in the table of means. The means of x and the logical variable are unchanged. 

```{r}

#Convert character, factor, and logical variables to numeric variables 
problem_one_df <- problem_one_df %>% mutate_all(funs(as.numeric))

#Find mean for each column as numerical variables 
means_table <-colMeans(problem_one_df)

#Show dataframe table with converted variables
problem_one_df

```
